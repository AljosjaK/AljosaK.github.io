When I first started modelling power, less than a year ago, I had very limited experience with data visualisation. In fact, I was completely new to R and had mainly (but limitedly) worked in Stata and SAS - where my goal was to get a hang of the syntax rather than to understand data formats (even though that might have been more important to be honest). However, I decided to switch to R because of the community surrounding the language, the open source and free nature of it and its potential for being one of the handiest tools for transparent research (i.e. its the best and fun and cool). 

Anyways, I was trying to model power for multivariate hypothesis testing. In the simplest of cases such test only includes two groups and two dependent variables - so this was what I set out to try to model and visualise. The power function for a hypothesis test is defined as the following:
