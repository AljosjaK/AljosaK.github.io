Well, so I have I. It is usually easy enough to grasp that low power = bad, high power = good - it\u0026rsquo;s name kind of gives it away. And given that significance is the holy grail in psychology most students would want a high probability to obtain it. The advice is often to calculate a sample size based on some previous (or just predicted) effect. However, for a two group experiment with a between group design and expected medium effect (which arguably could be seen as optimistic) we would need 64 participants if we want a probability of 0.8 of detecting the effect.\nFor many undergraduate students (and researchers in genereal) this is just not plausible. Yet, a lot of studies and dissertations projects obtain significance anyway. In my undergrad stats course I was told that this is evidence for the great magnitude of the effect, i.e. because the power of a test mainly is influenced by the number of participants and the size of the effect, if one is low in a significant study the other must be high - right? In fact this has been the predominant view by some scholars. Recently I stumbled upon this document, a handout by Karl Wuensch, a psychology professor at East Carolina University from his statistics courses in which he states:\n \u0026hellip;If you were to find a significant effect of the drug with only 25 participants, that would speak to the large effect of the drug. In this case you should not be hesitant to seek publication of your research, but you should be somewhat worried about having it reviewed by “ignorant experts.” Such bozos (and they are to be found everywhere) will argue that your significant results cannot be trusted because your analysis had little power. It is useless to argue with them, as they are totally lacking in understanding of the logic of hypothesis testing. If the editor cannot be convinced that the reviewer is a moron, just resubmit to a different journal and hope to avoid ignorant expert reviewers there.\n Yes, it is true that significance in a small sample would speak to the large effect found, but what Karl Wuensch seems to miss is that it does speak to the large effect in the sample. This does not necessarily (and most probably) not to the population of interest. Perhaps one is not interested in generalising findings and solely in describing one\u0026rsquo;s sample - however, I think that most would agree that this is not what the majortiy of psychologists want.\nBut why does not the effect we have found in the sample generalise to the population just because we have low power? Well, intuitively, which score on an IMDB film rating would you rather trust, an average of 9/10 given by 5 people or an average of 6/10 given by 100 people? My guess is that most would say the latter - because we put trust in numbers. In science this translates to a phenomenon called the winner\u0026rsquo;s curse. That is the tendency to over estimate the effect size in under powered studies, due to the fact that only the studies that happen to draw a sample with a large effect will obtain a significant result. Together with the publication bias (i.e. significant studies gets more published) this can yield a serious inflation of the effect sizes.\nTo demonstrate this it is useful to look at how such overestimation will affect a field \u0026ldquo;in the long run\u0026rdquo;.\nFigure 1: Median overestimation with Crawford and Howell (1998) method, 10^6^ simulations for every parameter combination.\n\r","date":1584403200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1584456528,"objectID":"4792175168e1d9fff85491b804896b8f","permalink":"/post/the-curious-case-of-the-winner-s-curse/","publishdate":"2020-03-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/the-curious-case-of-the-winner-s-curse/","section":"post","summary":"Key concepts:\n Power = the probability of finding an effect if the effect is true  Have you ever been at a psychology stats lecture listening to your teacher rambling about \u0026ldquo;power\u0026rdquo;, talking about its importance for your experiment to yield a significant result but without really explaining the \u0026ldquo;why\u0026rdquo; of it all?","tags":["Monte Carlo","Simulation","Power","Winner's Curse"],"title":"The Curious Case of the Winner's Curse","type":"post"},{"authors":["Jonathan Ö.

In particular, the thesis addresses how different covariance structures plausible in brain imaging, and strengths of the correlations between dependent variables in simulated variable systems affect the power of the analysis in relation to various combinations of effect sizes. The aim was to illuminate these relationships and offer insights in contingencies yielding the highest power, aiding researchers in designing powerful experiments. Simulations revealed that the most improbable conditions yielded the highest power, i.e. when effect sizes differed in size and/or direction, but the correlation was highly positive or when the effect sizes and directions were equal but the correlation highly negative. Similar patterns have been demonstrated before (Cole, Maxwell, Arvey, \u0026 Salas, 1994) but the present thesis offers a generalisation, demonstrating that the effect is present for an arbitrary number of dependent variables and groups. Furthermore, it is shown that multivariate analyses exhibit lower power when effect sizes are small as compared to medium even in situations where 6 variables exhibit a small effect compared to 1 of the variables exhibiting a medium effect. Difficulties in controlling the Type 1 error rate are addressed as well.","tags":["Monte Carlo simulations","Power analysis","MANOVA"],"title":"MANOVA and its contingencies: on the relation between power and correlation - Can the utilisation of multivariate analyses alleviate the power crisis in neuropsychology?","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Academic is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

Through this, providing evidence for the use of such constructions as a mechanism aiding individuals engaged in joint activities, including so called joint action. A significantly better performance was observed when such construction was possible in comparison with a condition where it was not, indicating that the construction of others’ associative mappings do occur, at least in conditional discrimination tasks. To further strengthen the indication that better performance was due to construction of the other’s associ- ative mappings and that this construction emerged due to social processing, EEG activity was measured during the task and compared to activity measured during a similar, though non-social, task. Oscillatory differences in EEG between conditions was used as an index of social perception. Differences in power/synchronisation over the alpha, beta and mu band between the conditions were analysed. All bands showed a significant increase in power in the social condition, although mu was expected to show the reversed pattern. Alpha increase may suggest inhibition of the self-perspective and beta increase could be related to processing of emotionally valanced stimuli or use of executive functions – both results may indicate that the social condition was perceived as social.","tags":["EEG","Frequency band analysis","Differential Oucomes Effect","Operant Learning","Forced Choice task","Emotional Contagion"],"title":"Oscillatory Differences in EEG - An index for social processing?
