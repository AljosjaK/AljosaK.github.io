How do the methods compare and what does their power curves look like? Can a multivariate approach to detecting dissociations be developed and would a power advantage to its univariate counterpart be found? Would such method more reliably measure the underlying contructs we believe to have found? To what extent does the winner’s curse affect neuropsychology? How would the distribution of corrected effect sizes look? All the above form the basis of the more general question: how can we improve the validity of neuropsychology?","tags":["Monte Carlo simulations","Hotteling's T2","Dissociation","Power","Winner's Curse"],"title":"Single Case Neuropsychology: validity and reliability in a power-wise pinioned field (work in progress)","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":["research"],"content":"Figure 1: Median overestimation with Crawford and Howell (1998) method, 10^6^ simulations for every parameter combination.\n\r","date":1584403200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1584456528,"objectID":"e7dbc15d3a104b9283c69342c3bbbe65","permalink":"/post/the-curious-case-of-the-winner-s-curse/","publishdate":"2020-03-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/the-curious-case-of-the-winner-s-curse/","section":"post","summary":"Figure 1: Median overestimation with Crawford and Howell (1998) method, 10^6^ simulations for every parameter combination.\n\r","tags":["Monte Carlo","Simulation","Power","Winner's Curse"],"title":"The Curious Case of the Winner's Curse","type":"post"},{"authors":["Jonathan Ö.

In particular, the thesis addresses how different covariance structures plausible in brain imaging, and strengths of the correlations between dependent variables in simulated variable systems affect the power of the analysis in relation to various combinations of effect sizes. The aim was to illuminate these relationships and offer insights in contingencies yielding the highest power, aiding researchers in designing powerful experiments. Simulations revealed that the most improbable conditions yielded the highest power, i.e. when effect sizes differed in size and/or direction, but the correlation was highly positive or when the effect sizes and directions were equal but the correlation highly negative. Similar patterns have been demonstrated before (Cole, Maxwell, Arvey, \u0026 Salas, 1994) but the present thesis offers a generalisation, demonstrating that the effect is present for an arbitrary number of dependent variables and groups. Furthermore, it is shown that multivariate analyses exhibit lower power when effect sizes are small as compared to medium even in situations where 6 variables exhibit a small effect compared to 1 of the variables exhibiting a medium effect. Difficulties in controlling the Type 1 error rate are addressed as well.","tags":["Monte Carlo simulations","Power analysis","MANOVA"],"title":"MANOVA and its contingencies: on the relation between power and correlation - Can the utilisation of multivariate analyses alleviate the power crisis in neuropsychology?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jonathan Ö.

Through this, providing evidence for the use of such constructions as a mechanism aiding individuals engaged in joint activities, including so called joint action. A significantly better performance was observed when such construction was possible in comparison with a condition where it was not, indicating that the construction of others’ associative mappings do occur, at least in conditional discrimination tasks. To further strengthen the indication that better performance was due to construction of the other’s associ- ative mappings and that this construction emerged due to social processing, EEG activity was measured during the task and compared to activity measured during a similar, though non-social, task. Oscillatory differences in EEG between conditions was used as an index of social perception. Differences in power/synchronisation over the alpha, beta and mu band between the conditions were analysed. All bands showed a significant increase in power in the social condition, although mu was expected to show the reversed pattern. Alpha increase may suggest inhibition of the self-perspective and beta increase could be related to processing of emotionally valanced stimuli or use of executive functions – both results may indicate that the social condition was perceived as social.","tags":["EEG","Frequency band analysis","Differential Oucomes Effect","Reinforcement Learning","Forced Choice task"],"title":"Oscillatory Differences in EEG - An index for social processing?
