abstract: "The findings of differential outcomes training procedures in controlled stimulus response
 learning settings have been explained through theorizing two processes
 of response control. These processes concern: i) a stimulus-response route, and,
 ii) an outcome expectancy route through which valuations of stimuli (typically
 auditory or visual) may be represented. Critically, under certain contingencies
 of learning, the interaction of these two processes enables a transfer of knowledge. 
 Transfer is hypothesized to occur via implicit inference for response selection 
 given novel stimulus-response pairings. In this article, we test this transfer
 of knowledge, previously only examined in individual settings, in novel social
 settings. We find that participants are able to achieve transfer of knowledge and
 suggest they achieve this through vicariously learning the differential valuations
 of stimuli made by the (confederate) ‘other’ involved in the task. We test this effect under 
 two experimental conditions through manipulation of the information
 made available to participants observing the confederate other’s choices. The
 results of EEG recordings are, additionally, evaluated and discussed in the context 
 of social signalling and emotional and cognitive empathy. We also consider
 implications for clinical and technological social learning settings."
