abstract: The main research questions for this project are which are the main statistical 
  methods used in single-case studies over the last ten years? How do the methods compare and 
  what does their power curves look like? Can a multivariate approach to detecting dissociations 
  be developed and would a power advantage to its univariate counterpart be found? Would such 
  method more reliably measure the underlying contructs we believe to have found? To what extent 
  does the winnerâ€™s curse affect neuropsychology? How would the distribution of corrected effect 
  sizes look? All the above form the basis of the more general question how can we improve the 
  validity of neuropsychology?
